# Notes

0. Obtain files **[Images.zip](Images.zip)** and **[Test Harness Master.zip](<Test Harness Master.zip>)**
1. The AF Project Provider does not resize the front panels of the VIs it creates. You may need to resize panels to show all controls and indicators.  
2. The expected text for all dialog boxes is paraphrased.  
3. `<Test Folder>` represents the path to a folder on disk created by the test operator.  
4. You may be asked to start from a clean version of **AFPP Test Harness.lvproj**. Obtain this project and its related files by copying the folder **Test Harness** and its contents from **Test Harness Master.zip** to a location of your choice on disk. `<Test Harness Folder>` represents the path to the copy of this folder you have created.  
5. Whenever a test step asks you to verify the appearance of a project, VI, or dialog, you can find the referenced image within the **Images.zip** file attached to this test.  
6. When testing on localized LabVIEW, messages will be placed next to the actor instead of in the *"Abstract Messages for Caller"* or *"Messages for this Actor"* folders. This is expected behavior.  
   - *Note:* If you want the messages to be placed in the folders, change the names of those folders to match the folder names you see (in your language) when you create a new actor via right-clicking **My Computer** and selecting **New > Actor**.

## 7. Create a message for a method with no inputs

- a. In the project, expand `Test Target.lvclass\Folder`.  
- b. Right-click on **Operation.vi**.  
- c. **Verify**: the **Actor Framework** submenu is available.  
- d. Select **Actor Framework » Create Message**.

    2. The block diagram appears as shown in **Operation Msg Send Block Diagram.png**.  
  - iii. `Operation Msg.lvclass:Do.vi` is correctly formed.  
    1. The front panel and icon appear as shown in **Operation Msg Do Front Panel.png**.  
    2. The block diagram appears as shown in **Operation Msg Do Block Diagram.png**.
- g. **Verify**: `Operation Msg.lvclass` and its methods are contained in  
  `<Test Harness Folder>\Test Target\Test Target Messages\Operation Msg`.

    1. Contains the attributes shown in **Write Data Set Msg Attributes.png**  
    2. Has the icon shown in **Write Data Set Msg Attributes.png**  
  - ii. `Write Data Set Msg.lvclass:Send Write Data Set.vi` is correctly formed.  
    1. The front panel and icon appear as shown in **Send Write Data Set Front Panel.png**.  
    2. The block diagram appears as shown in **Send Write Data Set Block Diagram.png**.  
  - iii. `Write Data Set Msg.lvclass:Do.vi` is correctly formed.  
    1. The front panel and icon appear as shown in **Write Data Set Do Front Panel.png**.  
    2. The block diagram appears as shown in **Write Data Set Do Block Diagram.png**.

## 10. Verify that you cannot create a message for methods with more than 6 controls

*(Not counting owning actor and error handler controls/indicators.)*

- a. Right-click on **Overload.vi**.  
- b. Select **Actor Framework » Create Message**.
